## Abstract
### Background 
To determine the relationship between arterial blood colour (CIE L\*a\*b\*) and blood oxygenation \[functional oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SaO2) and fractional oxyhaemoglobin saturation (FO2Hb)\], and if arterial blood colour can be used to predict arterial blood oxygenation.
### Methods 
A prospective randomised crossover study where 11 female impala were immobilised with opioids. Arterial blood was collected anaerobically into heparinised syringes and analysed immediately using spectrocolourimetry and co-oximetry. Data were analysed by modelling the relationship between predicted CIE L\*a\*b\* components and SaO2 and FO2Hb.
### Results 
The quadratic model produced a better fit than the null and the linear model for the CIE L\*a\*b\* components (p < 0.001) for both SaO2 and FO2Hb. Pseudo R-squared values were 0.94 for L*, 0.93 for a* and 0.92 for b* for SaO2 and 0.94 for L*, 0.94 for a* and 0.92 for b* for FO2Hb. The model produced Root Mean Square Error values of 0.66 for L*, 1.42 for a* and 1.65 for b* for SaO2 and 0.67 for L*, 1.39 for a* and 1.61 for b* for FO2Hb.
### Conclusions 
An association between the blood colour components (CIE L\*a\*b\*) and SaO2 and FO2Hb exists and arterial blood colour can be used to reliably estimate arterial blood oxygenation of impala.
